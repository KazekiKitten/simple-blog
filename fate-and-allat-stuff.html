            <p>It's interesting to see the concept of fate being explored from various sources of media.. (ahem.. webnovels ahemm..)</p>
            <p>Sort of like some people are fatted to meet each other, ig that is where the term soul mate also come from? I think it is pretty cool actually that we do have our free will but our fate have been determinded from the start no matter what we do, we are still following the path of fate without even realizing it. Some people will say smth like "Im gonna chance my fate by doing... [balh blah blah]" but is it really possible? what if the thing you set out to do is going as just fate have planned it out to be. Pretty interesting I would say.</p>
