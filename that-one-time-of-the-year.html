            <p>Published on September 20, 2025</p>
            <p>I feel like it is that one time of the year once again where everything start collapsing. Except I do not have any romantic relationship this time yet it still happenens. It is annoying, it is sad, it get me into this depressive state where I can't do anything effectively, just zooning out, thinking about how miserable I am and everything is. It's not like its everyone's fault, no no, I feel like its all mine actually, it's the reason why I akways remind people that I'm a horrible person so they don't expect much from me. "People are disappointing and peple will be people". It sucks. It makes me want to disconnect myself from everyone, block everyone then curl up and rot in my own bed. I'm just a horrible person I really am so what do I expect, it all backfires. I think I need away to archive my own happiness instead of relying on oters. Maybe.</p>
