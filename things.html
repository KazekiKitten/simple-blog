            <p>How shitty a life, for that I yearn for a selfish death that I do not deserve.</p>
<p>There are so many beautiful thing in this world yet I still wanted peace, the peace for my heart, the only thing that could not rest. I am grounded by those who surround me, held in check by love, care and responsibilities that I have to carry on my own. I wasn't this way before, I was childish, selfish, thinking that for all the things I've done, for all the pain I had suffered that I deserved to be selfish, oh how wrong that was. All the sins I've cause, all the people that have helped me and the fear of what comes next keep holding me back. God it hurts, it hurts so bad, I don't want to be dead, rather I wanted to never exist at all, or better yet disappear completely, never to be seen, remember. Oh how such a lonely existnce that would be.</p>
<p>What was I thinking in the first place. I never had a chance, really. Didn't I already told myself? Yet my heart, my mind, my actions betrayed my own vow, this is karma, this is the consequence. I tried to confused and dilute myself, telling that my feelings were invalid, that I just don't know what I'm feeling. Yet I knew it, I knew it deep down that I know it too, I know what I meant but the thought of it scare me. How fucking pathetic, vile, disgusting, shameful barely qualified to be human dare to have such feeling. Yet for that moment, I felt accepted, I felt like everything was right and things weren't so bad, all the weight of guilts went away, even just for a moment, I felt it, just to get reminded that NO ONE, no once understand. I wrote paragraphs of letters, letters that will never be sent. Annoying. truly annoying for once again I am reminded why I had built up these walls again.</p>
